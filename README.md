## Agentic-Profile-Matching

An LLM-powered recruiting assistant built with **LangGraph** that automates resume screening — from job description parsing to multi-round candidate ranking, explainable match reports, and interactive natural-language refinement. File system access is exposed via a standards-compliant **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**.

## Features

### Part A — Agent Architecture
- **LangGraph state machine** with persistent conversation memory (`MemorySaver`)
- **Workflow:** `START → Parse JD → Extract Requirements → Search Resumes → Rank Candidates → Generate Report → Human Feedback Loop → END`
- **Agent State** tracks:
  - Full conversation history (`messages`)
  - Parsed job requirements (must-have / nice-to-have)
  - Candidate pool, shortlist, and ranking reasoning at every round
- **Tools:**
  - File system tools (`list_resumes`, `read_resume`, `save_report`, `batch_process`, `watch_directory`) — served via MCP
  - `rag_search` — semantic resume search (Mistral embeddings + Chroma vector DB)
  - `extract_requirements(jd)` — parses must-have vs nice-to-have
  - `compare_candidates(candidate_ids)` — head-to-head comparison
  - `generate_interview_questions(candidate_id)` — tailored screening questions

### Part B — Interactive Features
- Natural language queries handled via intent routing:
  - *"Find me candidates with React and 3+ years experience"*
  - *"Compare the top 3 matches side by side"*
  - *"Why did John rank higher than Jane?"*
- **Iterative refinement** — adjust requirements mid-conversation; agent re-ranks and explains what changed

### Part C — Advanced Capabilities
- **Multi-round screening:**
  1. Initial screen → top N from full candidate pool
  2. Deep analysis → verifies skill depth, experience relevance, career trajectory
  3. Final round → hire / no-hire / borderline recommendation
- **Explainability:**
  - Detailed markdown match reports per candidate
  - Strengths mapped to requirements, gaps clearly flagged
  - Concrete improvement suggestions for borderline candidates
